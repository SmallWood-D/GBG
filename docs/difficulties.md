# Difficulties

This is a list of likely difficulties in creating GBG. The
purpose of the list is not to discourage but to help us
organize our efforts.


- We have relatively little experience with managing 
  many branches and versions of a piece of software
  for a long period. So there is no guaranty GBG will
  be useful to anyone.
- We do not know Git very well. We lack knowledge of
  workflows and of git's internals. These problems can make
  GBG less useful and make our implementation worse.
- We don not know GUI programming at all.
